#To write my story of the EDA Rhine Basin using 3-5 graphs/plots/tables, I chose to use 3 graphs because
#for me they are more representative than a table because you can see patterns and understand them more
#easily. For this first graph, I decided to illustrate the runoff annual mean of each station and the years.
#Firstly, it is important to see how the runoff changes over the years, if it increases or decreases. It can
#clearly be seen than the runoff of the Rhine river decreases in all stations. However, this decrease of the 
#of the runoff is not linear, it has been fluctuating all these past years. Moreover, in the past, the stations
#situated in the upstream showed a lower runoff than the ones in the midstream and downstream. However, 
#in the most recent years, most of the years data was collected, the highest runoff were in the upstream,
#meaning that temperature increased and it affected the snow and therefore there is a higher runoff than in
#the past.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
runoff_summary <- readRDS('data/runoff_summary.rds')
runoff_stats <- readRDS('data/runoff_stats.rds')
runoff_month <- readRDS('data/runoff_month.rds')
runoff_summer <- readRDS('data/runoff_summer.rds')
runoff_winter <- readRDS('data/runoff_winter.rds')
runoff_year <- readRDS('data/runoff_year.rds')
runoff_month_mean <- runoff_month[, .(value = mean(value)), .(month, sname)]
to_plot <- runoff_month[runoff_summary[, .(sname, category)], on = 'sname']

ggplot(to_plot, aes(x = factor(month), y = value, fill = category, group = month)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~sname, scales = 'free') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colset_4[c(1, 2, 4)]) +
  xlab(label = "Month") +
  ylab(label = "Runoff (m3/s)") +
  theme_bw()
#For the second graph I decided to include a boxplot from each station with the different months.
#In this study it was important to analyze the runoff from the different seasons (mainly summer and winter)
#to see the effects of climate change in the runoff. The hypothesis were that in the winter there is a 
#higher runoff than in the summer because temperature increases and melts the snow and it is later
#transformed into water that ends up in the river. Also, it is crucial to classify the different stations
#between upstream, midstream and downstream because as the snow melts, it goes to the river and the upstream
#runoff increases, but this does not mean that the midstream and downstream runoff also increases because
#if it's spring or summer, the temperatures are high and therefore evaporation is higher, hence the runoff
#lowers. The stations situated in the upstream and midstream have higher runoffs between may and September
#and it can be associated with the higher temperatures and the snow melting. Whereas in the downstream stations
#there are lower runoffs between august and November and this could be mainly explained with the temperature
#increase but also maybe more water was taken out for human activities.In addition, precipitation during 
#winter can increase, but they can decrease during summer. Related to the first figure, this is why runoff 
#decreases yearby year because precipitation during winter increases but at the same time, evapotranspiration
#during the warm month increases at a faster level. Nonetheless, not all the stations can be representative
#and hence further investigations need to be made to choose the ones that express more accurate what happens
#in the river's runoff.
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
runoff_summary <- readRDS('data/runoff_summary.rds')
runoff_stats <- readRDS('data/runoff_stats.rds')
runoff_month <- readRDS('data/runoff_month.rds')
runoff_summer <- readRDS('data/runoff_summer.rds')
runoff_winter <- readRDS('data/runoff_winter.rds')
runoff_year <- readRDS('data/runoff_year.rds')
year_thres <- 1980
to_plot <- rbind(cbind(runoff_winter, season = factor('winter')), 
                 cbind(runoff_summer, season = factor('summer'))) 

to_plot[year < year_thres, period := factor('1950-1980')]
to_plot[year >= year_thres, period := factor('1981-2016')]
to_plot[year < year_thres, period := factor('1950-1980')]
to_plot[year >= year_thres, period := factor('1981-2016')]

to_plot <- to_plot[year >= 1950]

ggplot(to_plot, aes(season, value, fill = period)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~sname, scales = 'free_y') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colset_4[c(4, 1)]) +
  xlab(label = "Season") +
  ylab(label = "Runoff (m3/s)") +
  theme_bw()
#For the last graph, I chose one that compared the different runoff from different years to see the behavior
#of the runoff with climate change between the seasons summer and winter. Stations situated in the up and 
#midstream have a higher runoff during the summer between the years 1981-2016 compared to the mean between the #years 1950-1980. Stations in the downstream seem to have a slight decrease in the mean runoff during the summer. On the other hand, during the winter, all stations had a lower runoff in the past than in the recent years. This could again be explained by the snow melting in higher altitudes. The decrease of runoff during
#the summer could also be explained by other variables, such as more dams built, more water being used for
#agriculture or for domestic purposes, new factories built near the river that take the water from it, etc. 
#Nevertheless, the initial hypothesis are confirmed, higher winter runoff due to snow melting and increased
#precipitaion and lower summer discharge because of reduced winter storage and higher evapotranspiration 
#due to higher global temperatures. 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
